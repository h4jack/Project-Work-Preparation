Perfect! Since you're preparing your friends for **further web development** (like React, Firebase, Node, etc.), you don't need to go *too deep* into HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”just enough for them to **build real layouts, handle user interactions**, and **understand the basics of the DOM and browser**.

Hereâ€™s a focused **checklist of essential topics** to teach in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no fluff, just whatâ€™s needed to move forward with confidence.

## âœ… **HTML â€“ Must-Know Essentials**

| Topic | Why Itâ€™s Important |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| `<!DOCTYPE html>` and basic structure | Understand the skeleton of a page |
| Head vs Body | Where to link CSS/JS, add metadata |
| Common Tags: `h1â€“h6`, `p`, `div`, `span`, `a`, `img`, `ul/li`, `br` | Build actual content |
| Form Elements: `form`, `input`, `textarea`, `button`, `label` | Crucial for login, register, search |
| Semantic Tags: `header`, `footer`, `section`, `article`, `nav` | Good for structure and SEO |
| Linking CSS and JS files | Setup for real-world projects |

## âœ… **CSS â€“ Just Enough to Style Well**

| Topic | Why Itâ€™s Important |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| Selectors: element, class (`.class`), id (`#id`)   | Basic targeting of elements |
| Box Model | Spacing, sizing, padding, marginâ€”core layout concept |
| Display: `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none` | Show/hide and layout control |
| Flexbox (only basics) | Enough for column/row layouts |
| Position: `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed` | Place things where needed (menus, headers) |
| Colors, Fonts, Borders | Basic aesthetics |
| `hover`, `focus`, `active` pseudo-classes | Add interaction feedback |
| Media Queries (simple) | Make layout mobile responsive |
| Class Reusability | Understanding utility-based styling (important for Tailwind later) |

## âœ… **JavaScript â€“ Focused on DOM & Interactivity**

| Topic | Why Itâ€™s Important |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| `var`, `let`, `const` | Declare variables safely |
| `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` | Basic logic and iteration |
| Functions (declaration & arrow) | Core for reusable code |
| Arrays & Objects | Handle data, especially from forms and APIs |
| DOM Manipulation: `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `innerText`, `innerHTML`, `classList` | Interact with and update the page |
| Event Handling: `click`, `submit`, `input` | React to user actions |
| Form handling & validation basics | Used in login, register, submissions |
| `JSON.stringify`, `JSON.parse` | Prepare data for APIs or storage |
| `localStorage.setItem/getItem` | Save session data (auth, theme, etc.) |
| `console.log()` & Debugging | Learn to trace and fix problems early |

## ðŸŽ¯ Project-Based Practice

Teach each of these with **tiny live examples**, and gradually combine them into one or two small projects:

* To-Do List App (JS DOM + localStorage)
* Responsive Product Card Page (@media CSS)
* Play with URLs Get Details and Show.
* Login/Register Form (HTML/CSS + JS validation)
